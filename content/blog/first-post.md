# First Post: Hello Internet, Here's My Learning Journal 📡

Hello, internet — and anyone who randomly stumbled upon this,

Welcome to my little home on the web — a **personal site** I created to document my journey of becoming a **Network Engineer**.

This is my very first post here. It may be simple, but it means a lot to me.

Why? Because this isn’t just about building a blog or portfolio — it’s about starting a habit: **learning through documentation**.

## ✍️ Why I Write

Not long ago, I realized something important: I often forget what I’ve already learned.

Sometimes I run into an error, spend hours troubleshooting, finally fix it… and then forget how I solved it just a week later.

But that entire process — the searching, the failing, the solving — is incredibly valuable.

That’s why I built this site. I wanted a space to **capture that journey**, including:

- Bugs and errors I encounter
- Troubleshooting steps I take
- What didn’t work — and what finally did
- Small lessons or insights along the way

Writing these things down helps me revisit them when needed. And if someone else happens to be facing the same issue? Hopefully, these posts can help them too.

## 🌐 Who Am I?

I’m still in the learning phase — exploring the fundamentals of networking, configuring devices, mastering essential commands, and understanding real-world protocols.

I don’t consider myself an expert. But one thing’s clear: **I’m committed to this journey**.

Each post I write isn’t just a note — it’s a visible trail of progress. Proof that I’m not someone who *used to study networking*, but someone who’s *actively building a strong foundation*, one step at a time.

Whether it’s for my future self or anyone curious about what I’m working on — including potential hiring managers — this site tells that story.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Heere

This blog will include:

- 📄 Error logs and bugs I run into while configuring networks or VMs
- 🧠 Technical notes from what I’m studying (subnetting, routing, switching, etc.)
- 🔍 Tools and commands I’m using
- 🤯 Stories of frustration and “aha!” moments throughout the process

Everything will be written in a casual, honest, and unfiltered tone — because I want to keep it real and personal.

## 🚀 Why This Matters to Me

Because I want to track how far I’ve come.

If I revisit this post a year from now, I want to smile and say:

*"I didn’t know how to do this back then — but now I do."*

And if I haven’t figured it out yet, that’s okay too. At least I’ll know where I got stuck — and that’s still progress.

## 📌 Final Words

Thanks for stopping by.

If you’re also learning the same things — or if you’re already working in networking — I’d love to connect.

Feel free to reach out through the contact info I’ve shared on the homepage.

My writing may not be perfect yet, but I hope it keeps evolving — just like my journey.

See you in the next post 🙌 :br **Stay curious, keep learning.**

Sometimes I just sit and think, ‚ÄúDamn, time really flies.‚Äù It's already 2025, and I'm 24. Looking back, my life feels like a series of small experiments. From playing games, messing with scripts, and eventually getting into the world of IT. And it all started with one thing: our home computer.

I still remember it clearly. I was around 6 or 7 when my dad bought a full PC setup. The CRT monitor was huge and heavy enough to tilt the desk. But to little me, that wasn‚Äôt just a computer. It was a window to another world. It ran Windows XP, the speakers had real bass. The processor, if I remember right, was an Intel Core 2 Duo E8500. That computer stayed with me until I finished middle school.

At first I only played the built-in Windows games. But everything changed around 2012 when we finally got internet at home. From that point on, everything shifted. After school, I‚Äôd throw my bag aside and sit in front of the monitor to play Facebook games. My favorite back then was Wild Ones, a 2D shooting game with cute animal characters.

That was also the first time I discovered Cheat Engine. It felt like finding a hidden path inside the digital world. I could set the damage to 9999, teleport characters, and all kinds of crazy stuff. From there I ended up in Facebook groups talking about cheats, admin panel scripts, even PHP code to ‚Äúadd money‚Äù in Dragon City or Social Wars. I followed every tutorial, even if I didn‚Äôt understand much. Later I realized, ‚ÄúWait, this is coding right?‚Äù That‚Äôs when I started getting familiar with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Besides cheating games, I also created a blog on Blogger. It was a mix of everything. Personal posts, template shares, screenshots. But that was also how I learned to edit HTML, add widgets, and customize layouts. Without realizing it, I was building the foundation of my web dev skills.

I also joined some tech groups that occasionally crossed into hacking topics. Some people shared how to claim crypto airdrops or trade scripts for Bitcoin. Yes, I actually had some Bitcoin back then. I got it from faucets and airdrops. I even traded some for game cheats. And the wallet is still around.

In middle school things slowly started to change. The cheat groups died down and Facebook games faded away. People moved to platforms like Instagram when the logo was still brown, Path, and the older version of YouTube. I followed the trend. Played around with Ask.fm, chatted every day on LINE, sent silly stickers, and posted dramatic status updates. During that phase I wasn‚Äôt coding. Not because I stopped liking it, I was just distracted by the social side of the internet.

After middle school I moved to Balikpapan and went to a vocational high school with a Computer and Network Engineering major. That phase really opened my eyes. From messing with cheats and blogs, I was now learning the real side of IT. Building PCs, troubleshooting problems, setting up LANs, configuring Debian and Mikrotik, even setting up local servers.

One moment I really remember was making a Wajan Bolic. It was a homemade Wi-Fi antenna using an old frying pan. It sounds ridiculous but that was one of the most satisfying things I‚Äôve ever done. I felt like a backyard scientist creating tech from scrap.

The highlight came during my internship at the airport. Every morning I walked from Gate 1 to the far end of the terminal to check the network. Sometimes I was asked to clean CCTV cameras on the runway, help disassemble X-ray machines, and even enter conveyor rooms that most people never see. That was a wild experience I‚Äôll never forget.

After graduating I went to college in Surabaya and studied Computer Engineering. I thought it would be similar to vocational school but more advanced. Turned out it was completely different. Even in the first semester I was already learning about microcontrollers, IoT, PLC, AI, and machine learning. I built Android apps and even soldered a 555 timer circuit for a freshman project.

To be honest I struggled sometimes. The field is huge and everything feels interesting. But that‚Äôs what keeps me excited to keep learning.

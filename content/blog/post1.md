Welcome to my very first blog post! ðŸŽ‰

This site is a result of my curiosity and continuous learning in the world of web development. I'm not aiming to become a full-time frontend developer, but I find building things like this website enjoyable and fulfilling.

In the future, I plan to write more about my experiences, especially around **IT Support** and **Network Operations (NOC)** as I dive deeper into that field.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned!
